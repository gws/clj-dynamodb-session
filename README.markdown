# clj-dynamodb-session

A [DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)-backed
[Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure) session store.

## Installation

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/gws/clj-dynamodb-session/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/gws/clj-dynamodb-session)

## Usage

```clojure
(ns your.app
  (:require [gws.middleware.session.dynamodb :as dynamodb]))

;;; 1. Create the store.

;; This will create a default store using a local endpoint, usually for testing.
(def ddb-store (dynamodb/dynamodb-store))

;; The above is equivalent to the following:
;(def ddb-store
;     (dynamodb/dynamodb-store {:client nil
;                               :endpoint "http://localhost:8000"
;                               :region nil
;                               :table-name "clj-dynamodb-sessions"
;                               :read-capacity-units 5
;                               :write-capacity-units 5}))

;; You can (and almost certainly will) override options such as the region and
;; table name:
;(def ddb-store
;     (dynamodb/dynamodb-store {:region "us-west-2"
;                               :table-name "my-app-sessions"}))

;; NOTE: If you set `region`, it will be used *instead* of `endpoint`.

;; You can even create your own Amazon DynamoDB client and pass it in as the
;; value of the `:client` key.

;;; 2. Pass the store to Ring.

;; If you are using ring-defaults, it looks something like this:

(def my-defaults
  (-> secure-site-defaults
      (assoc-in [:session :store] ddb-store)))

;; Now, you will use `my-defaults` as you would in any other Ring application.
```

## Data model

There are 3 fields created in the DynamoDB table that you specify.

- `id` (string): The session identifier.
- `data` (bytes): The session data, encoded with Transit using msgpack.
- `updated_at` (string): The timestamp of the last time the session was written,
  in ISO-8601 format.

Eliminating old sessions, if desired, is left up to you. There are other
middleware that can be used for session expiration, such as
[ring-session-timeout](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring-session-timeout),
but that will not clean data out of DynamoDB. You may want to periodically purge
old sessions based on the length of time you keep them using the `updated_at`
field.
